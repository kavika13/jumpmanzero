#[Jumpman Zero](http://www.jumpmanzero.com)

A platformer video game with a very old-school theme. Not to be confused with the original name of Nintendo's mascot, though Donkey Kong was an inspiration to Randy's vision of the game.

Based on the [Jumpman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpman) series by Randy Glover, released by Epyx in 1983.

Jumpman Zero is a completely original game with a similar theme to Randy Glover's Jumpman. It is written by Dave Campbell (along with other contributors).

Currently Windows is the only supported platform.

#About this repository

[The original home page for the Jumpman Zero project](http://www.jumpmanzero.com) is currently inaccessible. I haven't managed to get in contact with the author yet about this, but [an archive of the Jumpman Zero site](http://web.archive.org/web/20120527012046/http://www.jumpmanzero.com/) is still visible, as is the source code/tools and latest released version of the game.

Since the original version of the game was released under GPL, I feel it is fair for me to create this repository, also with a GPL license.

This repository exists in order to continue Dave's work, and to add Merlyn Morgan-Graham's work on porting the game to Linux and Apple OS X.

It seems from [Dave Campbell's Jumpman Zero developer diary](http://web.archive.org/web/20110713125316/http://www.jumpmanzero.com/pc/diary.htm) that some of his work never got publically released. Maybe some of those features or bug fixes will make it into this development branch at some point.
